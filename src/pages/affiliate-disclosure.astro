    <p>We include affiliate links to tools and templates we have vetted. Clicking them may earn us a commission. Pricing is always the same for you.</p>
    <p>Every tool card routes through <code>/go/[slug]</code> so we can track performance without storing personal data.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about a specific partner, email <a href="mailto:hello@axiomintel.online">hello@axiomintel.online</a>.</p>
