Start with a token-first library and ship a **definition of ready** checklist for every component. Use <a href="/tools/figma-system-starter">Figma System Starter</a> to sync tokens to Tailwind and create redlines automatically.

Add short Looms to capture intent before a PR ever opens. In review, compare shipping components against the design audit checklist to keep regressions out.
