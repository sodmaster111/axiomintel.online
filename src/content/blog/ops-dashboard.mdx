Leaders ignore dashboards that lack a **narrative**. Pair the metrics with a short Loom summary and a single decision request. Build the data layer in <a href="/tools/airtable-revops-base">Airtable</a> so ops can adjust without engineering tickets.

Auto-publish a formatted page in <a href="/tools/notion-sprint-ops">Notion</a> each Monday with week-over-week diffs. Track opens and reactions to see which sections should be cut.
