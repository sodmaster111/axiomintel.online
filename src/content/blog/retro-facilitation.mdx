Switch to a **single Miro board** (<a href="/tools/miro-retro-board">retro & alignment board</a>) that bakes in timers and voting. Run pre-work 24 hours before the session so people arrive with notes.

End with one owner per action item and a due date that lands before the next sprint. Follow up in Slack using the async kit so nothing slips.
