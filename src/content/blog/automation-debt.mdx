Every automation should have an **owner, purpose, and test case**. Store them in a living catalog inside <a href="/tools/airtable-revops-base">your RevOps base</a> with links to loom run-throughs.

Standardize naming (`verb-system-object`) and place error alerts in a dedicated Slack channel (<a href="/tools/slack-async-kit">async kit</a>). Review the catalog monthly and kill anything with low adoption.
