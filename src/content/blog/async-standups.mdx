Async standups work when you constrain the prompts and reduce noise. We ask for **yesterday, today, risk, help** and cap each answer at three sentences.

Use a single channel with **threaded updates** and schedule one weekly live review. Pair it with a <a href="/tools/linear-priorities-kit">Linear priorities scene</a> so blockers auto-link to the right issues.

Track adoption with reaction counts and reply times, then tighten the window until the team responds within 90 minutes.
