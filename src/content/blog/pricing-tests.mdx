Spin up experiments in a **feature-flag first** approach—toggle plan presentation while keeping SKU IDs stable. Track eligibility and conversions in <a href="/tools/make-automation-kit">Make.com scenarios</a> and mirror results to Airtable for analysis.

Prepare support macros before the test goes live and add Loom snippets that explain what changed. Once a variant wins, memorialize the workflow in your runbook so new teammates ship faster.
