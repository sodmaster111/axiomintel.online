Use **Notion** when documentation is the center of gravity and you need lightweight tasks connected to research. Choose **Asana** when you run heavy cross-team projects with dependencies and native reporting.

A hybrid stack works well: roadmap in <a href="/tools/linear-priorities-kit">Linear</a>, rituals in <a href="/tools/notion-sprint-ops">Notion</a>, and delivery in Asana if procurement already approved it.

Both tools benefit from a short list of fields (owner, priority, due window) and a weekly cleanup ritual.
