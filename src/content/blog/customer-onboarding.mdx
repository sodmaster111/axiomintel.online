Define a single **time-to-value (TTV)** metric and design every task to pull that date forward. Use a control tower board in <a href="/tools/airtable-revops-base">Airtable</a> with triggers for idle accounts.

For velocity, pre-record Loom walkthroughs (<a href="/tools/loom-sales-demos">demo library</a>) and embed them in the kickoff email. Make renewal probabilities part of the weekly CS review—not just at QBR time.
